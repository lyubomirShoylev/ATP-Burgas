# ATP-Burgas
 A collection of the exercise projects I was taught in the Academy for Talents in Programing in Burgas, Bulgaria, during 2015-2017.

There are two types of project here:
* Windows Universal Apps, from the time Windows Phone was still a thing.
* ASP .NET MVC Web Apps, using the .NET version of the time. Web interface was built using Razor markup and some Bootstrap elements.
